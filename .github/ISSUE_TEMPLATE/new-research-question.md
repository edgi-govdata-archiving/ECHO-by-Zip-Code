**What is the question you would like answered?**
(Example: "Over the last five years, what has been the overall trend of “cases” or formal enforcement actions in your region?")

**What information needs to be found in the data in order to answer this question?**
(The [ECHO Exporter Summary](https://echo.epa.gov/system/files/echo_exporter_columns_07242019.xlsx) excel sheet which shows what data is available may be helpful here.)

**Describe what the result should look like:**
(Example: a line graph where the X axis is time and the Y axis is GHG emissions, showing three years, for a single facility)

**What context can you provide for inclusion in the report? (Or, what context would need to be researched?)**
(Example: "Inspections serve as the front-end of EPA’s enforcement pipeline, the first step in determining whether to apply penalties or take violators to court.")
